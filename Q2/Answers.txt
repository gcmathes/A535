1.) There are 8 NMSU programs this semester. One of which is our visit, under "NM01."
I had some trouble understanding what the other actual programs were besides their 
dates. I got this info from the 3.5m schedule

2.) The All-Sky camera shows the location of warm items compared to the sky level. 
The images they show are compilations of the most recent photos with warmer objects
appearing much brighter. They note that because it is a differential compilation of
the last images, that the warmest objects may actually appear to be dark. This allows
us to determine the direction and speed of clouds in the sky. Finally, they include
the pointing of the 3.5 and 2.5m telescopes on these images for reference. 

The graphs show a history of sky measurements done over the past 14 hours, one
showing the differential from average sky level and the other showing a more 
absolute picture. 

3.) Is ARCSAT still running? Looking at the schedule, it hasn't listed anything for 
2016.
