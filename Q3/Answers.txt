The solar constant (SC) is about 1.366 kW / m^2. Doing a quick conversion to CGS,


SC_earth = 1.361 x 10^6 erg cm^-2 s^-1 


Sun's size is ~0.5 deg on the sky.
Convert to 0.0087 radians on the sky.
This brings us to about 7.615 x 10^-5 steradians.

Dividing our solar flux by this angular size, we get:


SB_earth = 1.787 x 10^10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 str^-1


Next, I want to calculate the solar constant from Jupiter.

We know from Earth it is 1.361 x 10^6 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Now, multiply this number by
the ratio of (d_earth / d_jupiter)^2 . This puts the flux at the reference frame
of Jupiter. 


SC_jupiter = (1.361 x 10^6) x (1 AU / 5.2 AU)^2 = 5.033 x 10^4 erg cm^-2 s^-1.


As for the surface brightness of the Sun from this position, there is no change 
from the Earth value. This is because even though the flux is decreasing as an
inverse square, so the does the area of the object on the sky. Therefore, these
two cancel each other out and we are left with the same surface brightness. 


SB_jupiter = 1.787 x 10^10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 str^-1
