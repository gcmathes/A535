MAGNITUDES :

1.) Between a g_1=17 and g_2=19.5, there is a difference of 2.5. This corresponds to
flux difference of 10 times. Lower number = brighter object, so:

g_1 is 10x brighter than g_2


2.) Star A is 10x brighter than Star B, by the same reasoning above. All that
matters is the difference in magnitudes, not the magnitudes themselves. 


3.) If we're using UBVRI, then B-V = 0 means the object has the same spectral 
energy distribution as Vega in the B and V bands.  

The spectrum would look almost flat in F_v, as the spectrum of Vega and a flat F_v 
curve are most similar. However, it would not be flat if we plotted it in
F_lambda.
